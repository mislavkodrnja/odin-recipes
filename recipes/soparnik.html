    <h1>Soparnik</h1>
    <img src="Soparnik.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Soparnik is a traditional pie-like dish from southern Dalmatia - specifically from the Poljica area between Split and Omi≈°. In Dalmatia, Soparnik (also known as zeljanik or uljenjak) is made in an extraordinary way, on an open fire - on something called a "komin" which is covered with hot coals from dried grape vines.</p>
