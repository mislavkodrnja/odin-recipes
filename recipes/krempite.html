    <p>Kremsnite is also known as krempite - which is a mix of crispy pastry and a wobbly type of custard.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Ingredients</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>500 gram puff pastry sheets (you can buy them, or you can make them fresh if you have time)</li>
        <li>485 ml fresh milk</li>
        <li>50 gram all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>2 eggs + 2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>100 gram white sugar</li>
        <li>30 gram vanilla sugar</li>
        <li>10 ml rum</li>
        <li>395 ml whipping cream
        </li>
        <li>Icing sugar</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p> <strong>Instructions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees</li>
        <li>Place the puff pastry on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and prick with a fork
         a few times and bake for 10 minutes - see the notes for more detail about the size
        </li>
        <li>Use a blender to mix eggs, yolks, flour, 250 ml of milk, 70 gr sugar, and 15 gr of vanilla sugar, and set aside</li>
        <li>Into a saucepan, pour 235 ml milk, 15 gr vanilla sugar, and rum and heat until boiling. Add the above mixture, stir and then cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes, constantly stirringly until the mixture is thick as a pudding - make sure it doesn't burn</li>
        <li>Place the first slice of puff pastry in a serving dish (we used one 25x25cm) and pour in the hot mixture. Refrigerate for 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Add 30 grams of sugar to the cream and whip till light and fluffy</li>
        <li>Remove the dish from the fridge and arrange a thin layer of whipped cream on top of the cream</li>
        <li>Place the second baked puff pastry on top and sprinkle with icing sugar to taste</li>
        <li>Cut the kremsnite into your desired-sized slices. We made them big and sliced them into six pieces - of course; you can make them much smaller
        </li>
    </ol>
